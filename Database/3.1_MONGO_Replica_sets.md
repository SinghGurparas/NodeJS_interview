# Replica Sets (Mongo DB)

## **1. What is a Replica Set?**

A **Replica Set** in MongoDB is a **group of `mongod` processes** that maintain the **same dataset**.
It provides:

* **High availability** ‚Üí automatic failover if a node goes down.
* **Data redundancy** ‚Üí protects against data loss.
* **Read scalability** ‚Üí you can read from secondary nodes.

It‚Äôs MongoDB‚Äôs primary method for **replication**.

---

## **2. Components of a Replica Set**

* **Primary** ‚Äì Receives all **write** operations.
* **Secondaries** ‚Äì Replicate the primary‚Äôs data (can serve **read** queries if allowed).
* **Arbiter** ‚Äì Votes in elections but does **not** store data (used to avoid ties in elections).

---

## **3. How It Works**

1. **Write** always goes to the **Primary**.
2. **Oplog (Operations Log)** in the primary stores each write.
3. Secondaries **pull the oplog** and apply changes to their own data.
4. If the primary fails:

   * An **election** happens.
   * A secondary is promoted to **Primary** automatically.

## **4. Replica Set Example**

### Initial Setup

```
Node 1 ‚Üí PRIMARY
Node 2 ‚Üí SECONDARY
Node 3 ‚Üí SECONDARY
```

### Write

```javascript
db.users.insertOne({ name: "Alice" }) 
// Goes to PRIMARY ‚Üí recorded in oplog ‚Üí secondaries replicate it
```

### Failover

If Node 1 fails:

```
Node 2 ‚Üí Becomes PRIMARY
Node 3 ‚Üí Remains SECONDARY
Node 1 ‚Üí When back online, resyncs as SECONDARY
```

## **5. Key Terms**

| Term                | Meaning                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Oplog**           | Special capped collection storing all changes on primary   |
| **Election**        | Process to choose a new primary                            |
| **Write Concern**   | Level of acknowledgment from replica set members           |
| **Read Preference** | Choose where reads come from (primary, secondary, nearest) |

---

## **6. Simple Setup Commands**

```javascript
rs.initiate({
  _id: "rs0",
  members: [
    { _id: 0, host: "localhost:27017" },
    { _id: 1, host: "localhost:27018" },
    { _id: 2, host: "localhost:27019" }
  ]
});
```

## **7. Replica Sets vs Sharding**

| Feature  | Replica Set                    | Sharding                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose  | High availability & redundancy | Horizontal scaling of data                     |
| Data     | Same data on all nodes         | Different portions of data on different shards |
| Failover | Automatic primary election     | Works with replica sets inside each shard      |

---

üí° **Interview Tip:**
If they ask *‚ÄúCan we have sharding without replica sets?‚Äù*, the answer is **yes, but not recommended** ‚Äî in production, each shard is usually a replica set for both **scalability** and **high availability**.

---

## **How Replica Sets integrate with Sharded Clusters**

Here‚Äôs the key connection:

* **Each Shard in a Sharded Cluster is actually a Replica Set**, not a single MongoDB instance.
* This combination gives **both**:

  * Horizontal scaling (sharding)
  * High availability (replica sets)

---

### **Full Architecture Components**

1. **mongos (Query Routers)**

   * Entry point for client apps.
   * Directs reads/writes to the correct shard based on the shard key.
   * Handles scatter-gather queries if needed.

2. **Config Server Replica Set (CSRS)**

   * Stores the cluster metadata (shard key ranges ‚Üí shard addresses).
   * Is itself a **replica set** for reliability.

3. **Shards (Replica Sets)**

   * Each shard is **not one machine** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **replica set**:

     * **Primary node** ‚Üí Handles all writes for that shard.
     * **Secondary nodes** ‚Üí Replicate from primary, can serve reads (if enabled).
     * Arbiter optional.
   * This way, if one node in a shard goes down, the shard is still operational.

---

### **Behind the Scenes Flow**

1. **Client sends query** ‚Üí to `mongos`.
2. **mongos consults Config Server** ‚Üí to find which shard(s) contain the relevant data.
3. **mongos routes query** ‚Üí to the **primary of the target shard's replica set** (or secondaries for reads if configured).
4. **Shard replica set** ensures:

   * Data durability via replication.
   * Automatic failover if the shard‚Äôs primary fails.
5. **mongos aggregates results** and returns them to the client.
