# process.argv

process.argv is a global property in Node.js that provides an array containing the command-line arguments passed when the Node.js process was launched. This array allows Node.js applications to interact with and respond to user input provided during execution.

The structure of the process.argv array is as follows:

- `process.argv[0]` :

    This element represents the absolute path to the Node.js executable that initiated the process.

- `process.argv[1]` :

    This element contains the absolute path to the JavaScript file being executed by Node.js.

- `process.argv[2]` -> [n] and subsequent elements :

 These elements represent any additional command-line arguments provided by the user when launching the Node.js script. Each argument is treated as a separate string element in the array.

Example:
If a Node.js script named app.js is run from the terminal using the command:

`node app.js arg1 --option value`

Then, within app.js, process.argv would be an array similar to:

```js
[
  '/usr/local/bin/node', // Path to Node.js executable
  '/path/to/your/app.js', // Path to the executed script
  'arg1', // First command-line argument
  '--option', // Second command-line argument (a flag)
  'value' // Value associated with the --option flag
]
```

`process.argv` is a fundamental tool for building command-line interfaces (CLIs) and for creating flexible Node.js applications that can be configured or controlled through command-line input.
