Alright — let’s go **deep dive mode** on those four microservices architecture points, using the **E-commerce example** and explaining the **behind-the-scenes mechanics** and the **important lingo** you’d use in an interview.

---

## **1. Each Service is a Separate Codebase & Deployment Unit**

**Example:**
We have 4 services:

* **Auth Service** → Handles login, signup, token generation.
* **Product Service** → Manages product catalog, categories, stock.
* **Cart Service** → Manages user’s cart items.
* **Payment Service** → Handles payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal).

**Behind the Scenes:**

* **Separate Codebase:** Each service is its **own Git repository** (or separate folder in a monorepo but built & deployed independently).
* **Independent Deployment Unit:** Each service has its **own Dockerfile** and **CI/CD pipeline** (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins). When you push code to `payment-service`, only that service’s image is built and deployed.
* **Versioning:** Services can have different release versions (`payment-service:v3.2.0` while `cart-service:v1.8.5`).
* **Runtime Flexibility:** Payment Service could be in **Java**, Product Service in **Go**, Cart Service in **Node.js**, as each service contains its runtime inside its Docker container.

**Terms to remember:**

* **Immutable Deployment** → Every deployment is a new container image; no patching running instances.
* **Service Boundary** → The “scope” of what a microservice is responsible for.
* **Loose Coupling** → Services don’t share code or runtime memory, only communicate over APIs.

---

## **2. Communication: REST / gRPC / Async Messaging**

**Example:**

* **Auth Service → Cart Service:** REST API call to verify user identity.
* **Cart Service → Payment Service:** gRPC call for faster, strongly typed interaction.
* **Product Service → Cart Service:** Async messaging via RabbitMQ to notify cart if product stock changes.

**Behind the Scenes:**

* **REST (HTTP/JSON):** Easy to use, language-agnostic, human-readable.
  Example: `GET /products/123` returns JSON.
* **gRPC (HTTP/2 + Protocol Buffers):** Faster than REST, smaller payloads, uses **proto files** for schema.
  Example: `payment.proto` defines a `ChargeRequest` and `ChargeResponse`.
* **Async Messaging (RabbitMQ/Kafka):**

  * **RabbitMQ** → Message broker, sends messages to specific queues.
  * **Kafka** → Distributed log, great for streaming and event sourcing.
  * **Example Flow:** Product stock changes → Product Service publishes `ProductOutOfStock` event → Cart Service listens and updates cart contents accordingly.

**Terms to remember:**

* **Service Discovery** → Kubernetes Services/DNS resolve service names to IPs (e.g., `http://payment-service` inside the cluster).
* **Event-Driven Architecture** → Systems react to published events without direct coupling.
* **Broker** → Middleman for message delivery (RabbitMQ, Kafka).
* **Schema Registry** → Ensures all services agree on data format in async systems.

## **3. Database Per Service (Polyglot Persistence)**

**Example:**

* Auth Service → PostgreSQL (relational, good for user data consistency).
* Product Service → MongoDB (flexible schema for product attributes).
* Cart Service → Redis (fast in-memory storage for quick cart lookups).
* Payment Service → MySQL (transactional integrity for payments).

**Behind the Scenes:**

* **Polyglot Persistence:** Each service picks a DB that fits its needs — you’re not forced into “one-size-fits-all” schema.
* **No Shared DB:** Prevents schema coupling — one team’s changes won’t break others.
* **Data Duplication:** Sometimes needed — e.g., Cart Service may store product names locally for speed instead of calling Product Service every time.
* **Sync via Events:** Payment Service can update order status in Auth Service DB by publishing an event.

**Terms to remember:**

* **Data Ownership** → A service owns its database; others must request data via APIs.
* **Eventual Consistency** → Data may not be updated everywhere instantly.
* **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** → Separate data models for write operations (commands) and read operations (queries).

---

## **4. Independent Scaling**

**Example:**

* On **Black Friday**, Cart & Payment services see high traffic.
* Kubernetes **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** detects CPU usage > 80% and spins up more pods **only for Cart & Payment** — no need to scale Auth or Product unnecessarily.

**Behind the Scenes:**

* **K8s Autoscaling:**

  * Metrics Server tracks CPU/RAM.
  * HPA compares metrics to defined thresholds.
  * Scheduler assigns new pods to available nodes.
* **Load Balancing:**

  * Kubernetes **Services** distribute requests evenly across pods.
  * External **Ingress Controller** (e.g., NGINX Ingress) balances incoming HTTP traffic.
* **Resource Limits:**

  * Each pod has **CPU/memory requests & limits** to avoid noisy neighbor issues.

**Terms to remember:**

* **HPA** → Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (scales pods count).
* **Cluster Autoscaler** → Adds/removes worker nodes based on resource pressure.
* **Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity** → Control where pods run for performance/redundancy.

---

### **Visual Mental Model**

If our **E-commerce app** was a monolith:

* One big process → all traffic hits the same deployment → if Cart is overloaded, the whole app suffers.

In **microservices with Docker + K8s**:

* Each service is **packaged** (Docker).
* K8s **deploys & scales** each one separately.
* Services talk via APIs or events, **discover each other** inside the cluster.
* Failures are isolated → Payment can go down without killing Product browsing.

---

If you want, I can now **map out a full diagram** showing:

* How each service communicates.
* Where databases sit.
* How Docker & Kubernetes wrap around it.

That would make it crystal clear for an interviewer. Do you want me to draw that next?
